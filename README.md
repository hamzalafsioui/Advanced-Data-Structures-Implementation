## Tree and Collection Implementations

### Description
This repository contains comprehensive implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C#. It includes:
- **Tree Data Structures**: General trees and binary trees with multiple traversal methods (PreOrder, PostOrder, InOrder).
- **Collection Interfaces**: Implementations of `IEnumerable`, `IList`, `IDictionary`, `ISet`, and `ICollection` with relevant methods.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of linear and bubble sort algorithms.
